## Vacuum Chamber

For a Fusor to fuse atoms the first necessary component is a vacuum chamber. I didn't want a mass produced vacuum chamber without soul, I wanted a locally made artisanal vacuum chamber (mostly because I didn't have the money for the first option). I can't pretend I have any great skill at the tasks involved, but I was able to get the work done and the vacuum chamber assembled. My chamber is essentially a direct copy of a design by Andrew Seltzman, you can find detailed open source plans from his own fusor build [here](http://www.rtftechnologies.org/physics/fusor-mark3-hemisphere.htm). If this summary with photos isn't enough for you, you can read the whole riveting (no rivets involved) process from start to finish [here](https://fusor.net/board/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=11638&start=10). My chamber is made from two hemispheres with a whole bunch of vacuum hardware welded to it. It has a total of 10 ports to which I can attach any number of gadgets.

### Machining
To begin I had to use a lathe to drill out the on axis ports of the vacuum chamber. I used various drills to enlarge the hole and then used a boring bar to take it to its final dimensions. I broke a couple of bits while doing this.

I had to use a tilting table to drill out the 4 off axis ports on each hemisphere. Again the process was basically the same as the lathe, drill out the hole with successively larger drill bits and then use a boring bar to take everything to the precise size. I broke some more bits.

I would not have been able to undertake any of this work without access to machine tools, [Protospace](https://protospace.ca/), a local makerspace in Calgary, provided access to those tools. Very kindly, they also provided training so that I didn't rip my hands off, and got an understanding of how to use these intimidating machines. After that I was off to the races, where I still made many many mistakes like say breaking lots of cutting tools. 
### Welding
Once all the holes have been made, the next step is to melt some metal! I bought a cheap TIG welding machine off of Amazon, and then had to procure all the bits and bobs to make it work. A gas tank, regulator, welding rods, electrodes, a lot of making things seems to be shopping for some reason. After that I practiced on some bits of scrap metal and I was able to go from terrible looking welds to okish looking welds. Then it was off to the races and doing all the welding on my chamber.

### Frame
Finally, I mounted the chamber in a frame made from aluminum extrusion. There are lots of places to get it, but I ended up ordering my frame from [Vention](https://vention.io/). They had a fancy little CAD tool online that let me make my frame online and then it got mailed to me pretty quick. I have no real complaints, other than to say it was a little bit pricey.

### Testing
Obviously if it's a vacuum chamber this thing has to be airtight, so I had to test it. I used a soapy water solution, applying it to all my welds and then pressurized the chamber with a bicycle pump. The first test did not go well....

So I had to take it apart, check all the welds, re-weld the holes I found and then run the test again. Thankfully the second test went much better!
